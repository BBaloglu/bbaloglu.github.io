I am a molecular biologist and applied AI researcher working at the intersection of data science, environmental genomics, and decision-making in complex systems. My work centers on building and steering AI-enabled analytical platforms that support judgment under uncertainty in scientific, public-sector, and policy-relevant settings.

I am an Adjunct Professor of Applied Data Science and Artificial Intelligence at the University of San Diego and previously taught machine learning in translational genomics at the University of Southern California Keck School of Medicine. Across teaching and applied work, I focus on helping teams reason clearly about complex systems, tradeoffs, and real-world constraints, not just models or methods.

I am a co-founder and Chief Scientific Officer of Wild Genomics, where I set scientific direction and led the development of AI-enabled environmental DNA monitoring systems from concept to deployment. Previously, as a Scientist III in Field Bioinformatics at Thermo Fisher Scientific, I worked on production-scale genomics platforms, resolving high-impact system failures and guiding cross-functional escalation across bioinformatics, engineering, and field teams.

My work also includes public-sector biomonitoring and applied analytics, including a U.S. EPA–funded international program and consulting for Singapore’s Public Utilities Board. I’ve been recognized by the U.S. Congress and UC San Diego for innovation in applied biotechnology and climate-related solutions, and received the Sustainability Merit Award at the Hong Kong Techathon+ in 2025.
