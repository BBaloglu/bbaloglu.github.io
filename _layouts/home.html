Iâ€™m a curious molecular biologist and data scientist. My research focuses on biodiversity monitoring and developing molecular and bioinformatics tools to make DNA sequencing technologies cheaper, faster, and more accurate. 
I earned my Ph.D. in 2018 from <a href="http://www.dbs.nus.edu.sg/">Department of Biological Sciences</a> at the National University of Singapore, where I was advised by <a href="http://www.dbs.nus.edu.sg/staff/meier.htm">Rudolf Meier</a>. 
Then I joined Dirk Steinke's lab at the <a href="https://biodiversitygenomics.net">Centre for Biodiversity Genomics</a>, University of Guelph as a postdoctoral research scientist. 
I got my B.Sc. degree in Molecular Biology and Genetics from <a href="http://www.global.itu.edu.tr/">Istanbul Technical University</a>. I also completed exchange studies for two semesters at the <a href="https://www.tum.de/en/">Technical University of Munich</a>.


  I am passionate about aquatic research, DNA sequencing technologies, and data science. I also had opportunities to do field work in the tropics as well as sub-arctic Canada, which I thoroughly enjoyed. Outside of science, I love writing, communicating science, travelling, climbing, and lately, weight lifting.
You can reach my publications, projects, talks, and several other resources from the tabs above.
