I am a molecular biologist and applied AI researcher working at the intersection of data science, environmental genomics, and institutional decision-making. My work focuses on how AI-enabled analytical systems can support judgment under uncertainty in scientific, public-sector, and policy-relevant contexts.

I am an Adjunct Professor of Applied Data Science and Artificial Intelligence at the University of San Diego and have previously taught machine learning in translational genomics at the University of Southern California Keck School of Medicine. My academic and applied work spans environmental genomics, machine-learning–informed bioinformatics, and the design of analytical systems used in real-world decision workflows.

I am a co-founder and Chief Scientific Officer of Wild Genomics, where I helped develop AI-enabled environmental DNA monitoring approaches, and I have worked as a Scientist III in Field Bioinformatics at Thermo Fisher Scientific. I have also contributed to public-sector biomonitoring and applied analytical projects, including a U.S. EPA–funded international effort and consulting for Singapore’s Public Utilities Board.

My work has been recognized by the U.S. Congress and UC San Diego for innovation in applied biotechnology and climate-related solutions, and I received the Sustainability Merit Award at the Hong Kong Techathon+ in 2025.
