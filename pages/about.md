Iâ€™m a molecular biologist and data scientist, currently in the lab of Dirk Steinke at the [Centre for Biodiversity Genomics](https://biodiversitygenomics.net/), University of Guelph.

I am passionate about aquatic research, method development for DNA sequencing technologies, and data science. Outside of science, I love travelling and climbing.
