Iâ€™m a molecular biologist and data scientist, currently a postdoctoral researcher at Dirk Steinke's lab at the [Centre for Biodiversity Genomics](https://biodiversitygenomics.net/), University of Guelph. I completed my PhD at the National University of Singapore, where I was advised by Rudolf Meier. Before that, I completed my undergraduate studies in molecular biology and genetics with Asli Kumbasar at Istanbul Technical University. 

My research focuses on biodiversity monitoring and developing molecular and bioinformatics tools to make DNA sequencing technologies cheaper, faster, and more accurate. I am passionate about aquatic research and data science. I had opportunities to do field work in the tropics as well as sub-arctic Canada.  

Outside of science, I love travelling, climbing, and lately, weight lifting. You can reach me at bilgenurb [at] gmail [dot] com
