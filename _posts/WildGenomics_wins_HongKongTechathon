So excited to receive the Sustainability Merit Award at this year’s HK Techathon+! Huge thanks to Raymond Chu for creating such an amazing event and to Grace Lai and her team for organizing it so seamlessly.

It was incredible to be part of a competition with over 1,800 participants and 300+ innovative proposals—so much talent in one place!

Big thanks to UC San Diego for nominating us. It was an honor to represent UCSD and the United States on this global stage. Shout-out to Shane Moise, Tim Schwartz, Marie Christensen, Jacques Chirazi, and HKSTP - Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks Corporation for this incredible opportunity.

Wishing everyone a Happy Chinese New Year—hope it brings success and exciting new opportunities!
