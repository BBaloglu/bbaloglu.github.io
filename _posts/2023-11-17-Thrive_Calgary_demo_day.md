This week we at Wild Genomics had a chance to pitch at the [Thrive Demo Day](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/thriveagrifood_academy-iii-demo-day-activity-7133899579707596802-s4So?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. Being a part of the Thrive community has been insightful, as it opened doors for us to industry experts and a network of farmers. Visiting Olds College of Agriculture & Technology in Alberta was a testament to how the Thrive community can help with validating technology and providing access to early adaptors. Learning from fellow innovators who are passionate about revolutionizing the food and agri-tech landscape has also been very exciting.

The highlight of our journey? Learning from the Demo Coach Nathan Gold, thanks to the support from [SVG Ventures | THRIVE](https://thriveagrifood.com/svg-ventures-thrive-launches-in-canada-and-establishes-their-innovation-and-investment-platform-with-headquarters-in-calgary-alberta/) and applying that knowledge on the pitch day! I'm proud to say that our team delivered a compelling presentation, showcasing our technology to a pressing issue in the agriculture sector, the growing impact of pests. Connect with us at Wild Genomics to learn more.

As if meeting everyone at the Demo Day was not enough fun, the event was so close to Banff, a place I've been dying to see for many years. Itâ€™s hard to describe the joy of hiking around Lake Louise and the Grassi Lakes. I will have to come back for sure!

A big thank you to the Thrive Canadian team, including Lisa Merdjan, Coleton Fisher, our mentors, fellow participants, and the supporters Alberta Innovates. Very happy to be a part of the Thrive community and highly recommend applying to their program!
