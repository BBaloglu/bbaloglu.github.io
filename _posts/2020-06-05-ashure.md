As I make my transition into the world of data science, I find it necessary to reorganize my past works into a github website. This project was inspired by [Griffin Chure](https://gchure.github.io), [Derya Akkaynak](https://www.deryaakkaynak.com/), and [Justin Bois](http://bois.caltech.edu/). They are scientists who works I admire, but I never met in person.

Hope I can also inspire you to follow and like me on Twitter, Github, and Researchgate!
