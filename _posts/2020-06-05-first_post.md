As I make my transition into the world of data science, I find it necessary to reorganize my past works into a github website. This project was inspired by [Griffin Chure](https://gchure.github.io) and [Justin Bois](http://bois.caltech.edu/), scientists whose works I greatly admire, but never met in person.
