From working on the bio assessment of Singapore's aquatic ecosystems together with PUB, Singapore's National Water Agency to helping with the DNA barcoding efforts on the Great Lakes with US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and to being a keynote at #TERIASconference talking about genetic tools for monitoring, cheap and at scale biodiversity monitoring with sequencing tools has been the core of my academic work in the last decade.

In the last 6 months, I have been working with Eirik Torheim, drafting our business plan on early detection of pest and invasive species in farmlands. Based on our interviews through the National Science Foundation (NSF) icorps program, we found out that early pest detection is important for farmers for two main reasons: Saving cost (via more controlled pesticide application) and abiding by pesticide regulations.

I am excited to share with you our work so far at Wild Genomics. Please feel free to get in touch with me and/or share with your network. We are especially interested in hearing from people with engineering expertise, including fellow students at #USC. Happy to chat if any of these peaks your interest.
