I was invited by the amazing organizers of the TERIAS conference (International Scientific Conference Invasive alien species threat: from theory to practice) to give a keynote speech on invasive species. My talk was titled "The challenges and new opportunities for DNA-based biomonitoring of aquatic invasive species."  

The conference was organized s one of the activities of EU based Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance (IPA) II project entitled ‘Addressing of invasive alien species threats in terrestrial areas and inland waters in Turkey’ between 19-21 September 2022 in Ankara, Turkey.

I also had the privilege of being on the panel at the closing ceremony, where all keynote speakers shared their insights about the knowledge gained throughout the conference, as well as answered questions from the public, academics, and the representatives of the Ministry of Environment, Urbanisation and Climate Change and the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry of the Republic of Turkey.

Overall, there were so many exciting conversations, and I was able to make many connections with academics from Turkey. I am so very thankful that the organizers supported and believed in me. Onto such opportunities in the near future!
